# [Emergency Commentary] Democrats Backlash Against New SEC Leadership: Impact on the Crypto Market and 3 Defense Strategies

"I’ve started my New NISA, but the recent cryptocurrency news is just too difficult to follow..." Do you feel this way? 📈

In reality, the political conflict surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a critical theme that significantly impacts the asset values of those of us living in Japan. In particular, the recent criticism from the Democratic Party toward SEC Chair Atkins is a movement that cannot be overlooked when gauging the future transparency of the market.

### Democrats Criticize Chair Atkins: The Points of Contention are "Investor Protection" and "Rulemaking"

Currently, intense debates regarding cryptocurrency regulation are taking place in the U.S. political arena. As Chair Atkins attempts to shift from the previous "regulation by enforcement" approach to a policy more supportive of the industry, the Democratic Party has expressed strong concerns. ⚠️

There are three key points to note:

*   **Concerns over Regulatory Gaps**: Democratic lawmakers fear that the current easing stance may neglect investor protection and create loopholes that allow for fraud.
*   **Legal Framework Uncertainty**: Their argument is that loosening regulations before clear laws are established will, conversely, invite market chaos.
*   **Intensification of Partisanship**: It has become clear that cryptocurrency has moved beyond mere technology and has become a political "point of contention."

This situation, where the head of a regulatory authority is under fire, is expected to create "uncertainty" in the market in the short term and act as a factor that increases price volatility. 💡

### Investment Strategies to Win in a Volatile Market

In phases where prices fluctuate due to political movements, it is crucial to remain calm and act through reliable platforms without being swayed by emotions. The current turmoil in the U.S. can be viewed as a phenomenon unique to a "transitional period before rules are established."

Why are these tools necessary now? It is because when information is convoluted, an environment where you can manage your assets easily and with a sense of speed is indispensable. Being tossed about by political news and missing the timing for buying or selling is the biggest "opportunity loss" that beginners often fall into.

### What You Can Do Now to Prevent "Opportunity Loss"

In the world of investment, there are many instances where a major trend shifts while you are "waiting and seeing." The cryptocurrency market, in particular, can see its entire landscape change based on a single U.S. regulatory policy. 📈

The difference between those who regret, saying "I should have prepared sooner," and those who firmly established their footing during uncertain times will manifest as a significant gap in asset totals a few months down the line. Setting up an environment where you can move your own assets, even starting with a small amount, is the first step toward risk avoidance.
